# Nearest_CovidHospital_BasedOnYourLocation-
Using #seleniumautomation and #puppeteer, I have created an Automated Script which will help people to search for nearest Covid Hospitals along with number of Covid beds available at present, Hospital Address and Contact Number etc by entering his/her geolocation. 

People will also get to know real-time distance and the Estimated time to reach nearest hospital with the help of Google Map

Script will fetch the list of covid hospital from delhi govt site. and give us list of hopitals along with  number of covid beds available at present and othe details of the hopital. From google map script will fetch the distance and time it would take to reach each hospital from the geolaction of the user entered at time of running the script.

This will help user to locate nearest covid hospital based on number of beds vacant, time to reach hopital.
